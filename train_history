binary cross entropy, pos_weight=4
too many false positives

V0 20X slide_level=0
V1 10X slide_level=1, 512*512 field of view  4 times as many patches as V2
V2 5X  slide_level=2, 512*512 field of view

the performance of V1 is better than that of V2.

v1 model predict v2 data, performance totally bad.

the performance of model ensemble is a little better than that of the best model.
